Fly your plane while coming up with music for the next Eurovision contest!
Tap on the notes in the clouds to score points- the closer you get to tapping it on the beat, the more points you score. But, you lose points if a note leaves the screen!
Swipe left and right to make your plane dodge various obstacles- if you get hit, you'll lose points and you won't be able to tap on notes for a short time.
If you miss too many notes too quickly, you lose the level and have to try again. Make it to the end of each level to unlock the next one!
